# Weathermeter

I got the idea and the initial user stories for this project from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather)

## Initial user stories
* [x] As a user, I can see the weather in his current location
* [x] As a user, I can see different icons or background images (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather

## Try out
If you want to try it out, just clone the repository and use
  
    npm -i
    npm start
  
and then you can access it with localhost:3000 

## Resources
As recommended, I will use [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/current#geo)

### Icons
Since I could not find a single library with all icons I needed, I use a combination of the following libraries to 
display icons for the weather data.

* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)
* [weather-icons](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons)
* [meteocons](www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons)

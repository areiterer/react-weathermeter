# Weathermeter

I got the idea and the initial user stories for this project from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather)

## Initial user stories
* [ ] As a user, I can see the weather in his current location
* [ ] As a user, I can see differen ticons or background images (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather
* [ ] As a user, I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius

## Resources
As recommended, I will use [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/current#geo)
